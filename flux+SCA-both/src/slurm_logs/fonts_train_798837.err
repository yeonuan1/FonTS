'repr' is field-specific metadata, and can only be attached to a model field using `Annotated` metadata or by assignment. This may have happened because an `Annotated` type alias using the `type` statement was used, or if the `Field()` function was attached to a single member of a union type.

You are using the default legacy behaviour of the <class 'transformers.models.t5.tokenization_t5.T5Tokenizer'>. This is expected, and simply means that the `legacy` (previous) behavior will be used so nothing changes for you. If you want to use the new behaviour, set `legacy=False`. This should only be set if you understand what it means, and thoroughly read the reason why this was added as explained in https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/24565
You are using a model of type mt5 to instantiate a model of type t5. This is not supported for all configurations of models and can yield errors.
Using a slow image processor as `use_fast` is unset and a slow processor was saved with this model. `use_fast=True` will be the default behavior in v4.52, even if the model was saved with a slow processor. This will result in minor differences in outputs. You'll still be able to use a slow processor with `use_fast=False`.
